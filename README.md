# Project 1

In this project we investigated the data sets provided to us of the 2017 & 2018 SAT and ACT scores. After cleaning and manipulation of our data we were able to create meaning full graphics to highlight different metrics. 
### What was found

During this project I was able to conclude that there was no coolation between scores on the SAT and ACT due to several factors. 

By showing the Scatter plots of the two tests we could clearly see that the data had no correlation. 

#### Usage
For usage of this code pleas have jupyter notebooks installed

when at the appropriate location on your machine please run:  

```python
Jupyter Notebook 
```
to activate a Jupyter Notebook to view the code. 

running the code from the beginning one time to avoid any issues with over writing any data frame values. 

##### If any edits need to be made:
please be advised that it is best practice to run all cells above the previously edited block.
